# Coat-check

You are tasked with writing a small coat-checking program! You need to create a program that takes in a user's name and any coats and bags they want to check-in while visiting. The program should then search through the checked-in items by name, and allow users to check out; in doing so, the user should not be able to find checked-out coats and bags.
